Subject: Request for Consideration – VibeCoding Theme/Use Case Submission

Dear [Manager's Name / Sir / Madam],

I hope this message finds you well.

I sincerely apologize for missing the submission deadline for the VibeCoding theme/use case. Due to [briefly mention a valid reason if appropriate—e.g., overlapping priorities, unforeseen workload, etc.], I was unable to submit my entry on time.

However, I have put considerable effort into developing a comprehensive and innovative DevOps Dashboard use case, which I believe aligns strongly with the objectives of VibeCoding. I am writing to kindly request your permission to still be considered for participation, if possible.

I assure you that I am committed to making a valuable contribution and am prepared to share the complete details of my solution immediately, should you allow my entry to be reviewed.

I truly appreciate your understanding and consideration, and I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to be part of this initiative.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
