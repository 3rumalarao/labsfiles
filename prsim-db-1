Perfect — the screenshots show exactly the **side navigation structure** and **overall dark-themed dashboard layout** you want to replicate.

Here’s a **complete set of step-by-step prompts** you can give to **lovable.dev** to recreate your attached UI design in one cohesive, credit-efficient flow — while making it easy for **junior developers** to maintain and extend:

---

## ✅ PROMPT 1 — Navigation Sidebar Structure

> **Prompt:**
>
> I want to create a **dark-themed vertical side navigation bar** for a DevOps dashboard targeted at junior developers. The navigation should include these collapsible groups and items, with matching icons:
>
> * **Overview** (home icon)
> * **Pipelines** (branch icon) with:
>
>   * Build Pipelines
>   * Release Pipelines
>   * Pipeline History
>   * Pipeline Templates
> * **Infrastructure** (bar-chart icon) with:
>
>   * Servers
>   * Containers
> * **Applications** (document icon)
> * **Environments** (settings icon)
> * **Security** (warning/lock icon) with:
>
>   * SSL Certificates
>   * Access Control
> * **Team** (user icon) as a bottom-pinned item
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Dark mode UI with light text on dark background
> * Highlight active section with a subtle background or color
> * Collapsible groups (e.g., clicking “Pipelines” expands/collapses sub-items)
> * Icons similar to those shown in attached screenshots
> * Responsive design: collapse sidebar to icons only on small screens
> * Keep styles simple for junior developers to understand (e.g., Tailwind or minimal CSS-in-JS)

## ✅ PROMPT 2 — Dashboard Overview Page Layout

> **Prompt:**
>
> I need the **main dashboard page** layout to match the attached screenshots. The design should include:
>
> * **Top bar** with:
>

>   * Date range selector (e.g., “Last 24 Hours” or Jul 28 – Aug 4, 2025)
>   * Refresh button
>   * Download report button
>   * Edit layout button
>   * Notifications/settings icons on the right
> * **Dashboard Overview header** with subtitle: “Monitor your cloud infrastructure, pipelines, and services at a glance”
> * **Recent DevOps Activity** section with horizontally scrollable cards showing:
>
>   * App name, version, environment badge (e.g., Production/Staging)
>   * Status (Success/Failed)
>   * Description text
>   * Duration, time ago, pipeline link, and version details
> * **Pipeline Status** section with summary cards for:
>
>   * Successful Builds (number + % change)
>   * Failed Builds (number + % change)
> * **Application Status** section with:
>
>   * Healthy Apps
>   * Down Apps
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Dark mode styling matching the sidebar
> * Card-based layout with rounded corners and subtle shadows
> * Easy-to-understand code/comments for junior developers
> * Responsive design: stack sections vertically on mobile
> * Use Tailwind, Chakra, or a simple CSS solution

## ✅ PROMPT 3 — Detailed Monitoring Widgets

> **Prompt:**
>
> Add these **detailed monitoring sections** to the same dashboard page:
>
> * **SSL Certificates** section with:
>
>   * Expired count, expiring soon count, total critical count in summary cards
>   * Detailed list of certificates: domain name, environment badge (e.g., QA, Staging), expiry date, provider, and a status badge (Expired, X days left)
> * **Container Status** section with:
>
>   * Count of Down and Unhealthy containers
>   * List of containers with details: name, image, CPU/memory usage, last restart time, and error messages
> * **Cloud Services Health** section with:
>
>   * Count of Healthy, Warning, and Critical services
>   * Detailed list of cloud instances (e.g., Compute Engine Cluster) with provider, environment badge, region, uptime %, CPU/memory usage, response time, and current health status
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Match the visual style of the attached images (cards with dark backgrounds, badges for status, readable typography)
> * Sections should be modular components for reusability
> * Accessible for screen readers (use ARIA labels)
> * Maintain consistent spacing/padding across sections

## ✅ PROMPT 4 — Cohesive Integration & Final Styling

> **Prompt:**
>
> Integrate the navigation sidebar, top bar, dashboard overview sections, and monitoring widgets into a single cohesive **dashboard page**.
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Ensure sidebar is always visible on large screens; collapses on small screens
> * Top bar sticks to the top on scroll
> * Smooth transitions when collapsing/expanding sidebar or sections
> * All elements should follow the same dark theme with consistent colors, spacing, and typography
> * Junior developer-friendly code: modular React components with clear file structure (e.g., components/Sidebar, components/TopBar, components/ActivityCards, etc.)
> * Add a light border or divider between sections for visual separation

---

## 🔥 Optional Prompt if Credits Allow — Polish & Docs

> **Prompt:**
>
> Provide final **code cleanup, inline comments, and README documentation** for junior developers explaining:
>
> * How to run the dashboard locally
> * How to customize sections or add new widgets
> * Where to configure API endpoints for real-time data
